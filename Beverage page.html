            Teh tarik is a popular hot milk beverage that is most frequently found in mamaks, outdoor stalls and 
            kopitiams in Malaysia. The drink's name comes from the preparation method of continuously pouring the 
            drink back and forth with arms extended, which helps to slightly cool the tea and create its own unique 
            texture. It is made from a strong brew of black tea blended with condensed milk. It's also Malaysia National 
            beverage.

            thick, and sugar-sweetened, were stirred into the drink. It is commonly accessible in coffee shops, street 
            food vendors, and hawker stands.

            White coffee is a popular drink originated in Ipoh, Malaysia. It is served with condensed milk after the 
            coffee beans are roasted using palm oil margarine. The part of the brewing process has no additional material
            or ingredient add to the coffee beans. It is just roasted with margarine, not sugar, giving a coffee a lighter 
            colour which makes it unique because other forms of coffee are often roasted with sugars, margarine, and wheat.
