            <br>Malaysia is a unique country because Malaysia is a rich mixture of cultures, modern buildings next to traditional spice 
            markets, and rainforests teeming with rare and endangered species. The Malaysian diversity of ethnicities and religions is 
            celebrated throughout the year with many different multicultural festivals. Because Malaysia's population is so diverse, 
            Malaysian people wiil organize open houses in conjunction with festive occasions such as Hari Raya Aidilfitri, Chinese New 
            Year, and Deepavali. The organization of open houses allows Malaysian to enjoy various types of food from different ethnicities.
            This is because open houses typically involve the preparation of food from various cultures and traditions, including Malay, 
            Chinese, Indian, and other ethnic foods found in Malaysia. The organization of open houses also can help to strengthen unity 
            among races and relationships within society.

           <br>Futhermore, the variety of people in Malaysia makes for a very interesting mix of cuisineâ€”spicy Malay dishes, an endless variety of 
           Chinese food, exotic cuisine from North and South India, as well as local Nyonya and Portuguese dishes. Most dishes contain lots of 
           spices, chilies, and coconut cream. Fish is made for any occasion and in many styles.

            <br>Thus, the Malaysian can live in a peaceful and harmonious condition, even respecting each other.
